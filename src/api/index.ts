/**
 * Central export for the API module.
 * 
 * Combines all API routes from individual modules into a single object
 * that can be spread into Bun's serve() routes option.
 * 
 * Route Modules:
 * - health: Server health check endpoint
 * - loops: Loop CRUD, control, data, and review operations
 * - models: AI model listing and user preferences
 * - settings: Server configuration and connection management
 * - git: Git repository information
 * - workspaces: Workspace CRUD operations
 * - agents-md: AGENTS.md optimization for Ralpher
 * - ssh-servers: Standalone SSH server registry, credentials, and ad-hoc sessions
 * - ssh-sessions: Workspace-backed persistent SSH sessions
 * - provisioning: Remote workspace provisioning jobs
 * - websocket: Real-time event streaming (handled separately)
 * - port-forwards: Browser-facing proxy routes handled separately in src/index.ts
 * 
 * @module api
