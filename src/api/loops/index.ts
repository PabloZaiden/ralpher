/**
 * Loops API endpoints for Ralph Loops Management System.
 *
 * This module provides comprehensive CRUD operations and lifecycle control for Ralph Loops:
 * - CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete loops
 * - Control: Accept, push, discard, and purge completed loops
 * - Plan Mode: Create, review, and accept plans before execution
 * - Chat: Interactive single-turn conversations on the same loop infrastructure
 * - SSH: Loop-linked SSH session management
 * - Port Forwards: Loop-scoped remote service exposure
 * - Review: Address reviewer comments on pushed/merged loops
 * - Data: Access loop diffs, plans, status files, and PR navigation metadata
 *
 * Uses the CommandExecutor abstraction over the configured execution channel:
 * - local provider: commands run on the Ralpher host
 * - ssh provider: commands run on the remote workspace host
 *
 * @module api/loops
