## Agentic Workflow — Planning & Progress Tracking

When working on tasks, follow this workflow to ensure clarity, goal alignment, and resilience to context loss:

### Planning

- At the start of any multi-step task, write your goals and plan in \`./.planning/plan.md\`.
- Track the status of each task in \`./.planning/status.md\`.
- Make sure that goals are written down in a way that you can properly verify them later.
- Don't say something is done until you have verified that all goals are met.

### Incremental Progress Tracking

- After completing each individual task, **immediately** update \`./.planning/status.md\` to mark it as completed and note any relevant findings or context.
- Do **not** wait until the end of a session to batch-update progress — update after every task so that progress is preserved even if the session is interrupted or context is lost.

### Pre-Compaction Persistence

- Before ending your response, update \`./.planning/status.md\` with:
  - The task you are currently working on and its current state
  - Updated status of all tasks in the plan
  - Any new learnings, discoveries, or important context gathered
  - What the next steps should be when work resumes
- This ensures progress is preserved even if the conversation context is compacted or summarized between iterations. Treat the status file as your persistent memory.

### Goal Verification

- Before considering work complete, check \`./.planning/plan.md\` and \`./.planning/status.md\` to ensure all tasks are actually marked as completed.
- Follow this general loop:
  1. Write down goals in the plan
  2. Implement the work
  3. Verify all goals are met
  4. Update status with progress
  5. If all goals are met, you are done; otherwise, continue from step 2`;
