# Ralpher API Reference

This document describes the REST API for the Ralpher Loop Management System.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:3000/api
```

The port can be configured via the `RALPHER_PORT` environment variable, and the bind host can be configured via `RALPHER_HOST`.

## Authentication

By default, the API does not require application-level credentials. In production deployments, Ralpher is still expected to run behind a reverse proxy that enforces authentication and authorization.

Ralpher also supports optional built-in HTTP Basic auth. When `RALPHER_PASSWORD` is set to a non-empty value after trimming, every request requires Basic auth credentials. The username defaults to `ralpher` and can be overridden with `RALPHER_USERNAME`.

Example:

```http
Authorization: Basic cmFscGhlcjpzZWNyZXQ=
```

This built-in auth applies to REST requests, websocket upgrade requests, and browser requests for the SPA.

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Successful responses return the requested data directly. Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "error_code",
  "message": "Human-readable error description"
}
```

## ACP Agent Runtime Architecture

Ralpher runs agent interactions through ACP JSON-RPC and supports two providers:

- `opencode` (CLI command: `opencode acp`)
- `copilot` (CLI command: `copilot --yolo --acp`)

Agent transport is configured per workspace:

1. **Local ACP** (`stdio`): provider CLI is launched on the local host.
2. **Remote ACP** (`ssh`): provider CLI is launched over SSH on the target workspace host.

This agent channel handles sessions, prompts, streaming updates, tool events, and permission/question requests.

## Command Execution Architecture

All API endpoints that perform deterministic server-side operations (git commands, file operations, etc.) use the `CommandExecutor` abstraction:

1. **Local execution** (`stdio` transport): commands run directly on the local host.
2. **Remote execution** (`ssh` transport): commands run over SSH on the target workspace host.
3. **Bounded execution**: command operations enforce timeouts and explicit success/failure results.

This execution channel is decoupled from ACP streaming/provider internals. The following operations use deterministic command execution:

- Git operations (`/api/git/branches`, loop git operations)
- File existence checks (`/api/check-planning-dir`)
- File reads (`/api/loops/:id/plan`, `/api/loops/:id/status-file`)
- Directory listings

## Endpoints

### Health Check

#### GET /api/health

Check if the server is running.

**Response**

```json
{
  "healthy": true,
  "version": "0.0.0-development"
}
```

The `version` field is read from `package.json` at startup and will reflect the actual build version.

#### POST /api/loops

Create a new loop.

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Loop name shown in the UI. The dashboard can generate a suggested name with `POST /api/loops/title`, but the final value is submitted by the client. |
| `workspaceId` | string | Yes | ID of the workspace to create the loop in |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Task prompt/PRD (non-empty) |

| `git.commitScope` | string | No | Optional Conventional Commit scope override (default: empty string). When provided, use a meaningful module, section, or topic such as `"auth"` or `"api"`. Leave it empty to generate scope-less commits. Generic placeholder values such as `"ralph"` are treated as empty. The deprecated `git.commitPrefix` is still accepted and converted the same way. |
| `baseBranch` | string | No | Base branch to create the loop from (default: auto-detected default branch) |
| `clearPlanningFolder` | boolean | No | Clear .planning folder before starting (default: false) |

| 400 | `accept_failed` | Cannot accept (e.g., loop still running) |

#### POST /api/loops/:id/push

Push a completed loop's branch to remote for PR workflow.

**Response**

When the push succeeds normally:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "remoteBranch": "origin/add-dark-mode-toggle-a1b2c3d",
  "syncStatus": "clean"
}
```

When the branch is already up to date with the remote:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "remoteBranch": "origin/add-dark-mode-toggle-a1b2c3d",
  "syncStatus": "already_up_to_date"
}
```

When merge conflicts are detected and being resolved (push deferred):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "syncStatus": "conflicts_being_resolved"
}
```

Note: When `syncStatus` is `"conflicts_being_resolved"`, the `remoteBranch` field is absent.

**Errors**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `not_found` | Loop not found |
| 400 | `push_failed` | Cannot push (e.g., loop still running or no remote) |

#### POST /api/loops/:id/update-branch

Update a pushed loop's branch by syncing it with the latest base branch and re-pushing if possible.

If the sync is clean, the loop remains in `pushed` status and the updated branch is pushed immediately. If conflicts are detected, Ralpher starts the conflict-resolution flow and auto-pushes when that flow completes.

**Response**

Uses the same response shape as `POST /api/loops/:id/push`.

**Errors**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `not_found` | Loop not found |
| 400 | `update_branch_failed` | Cannot update the pushed branch |

| 400 | `invalid_session_configuration` | Loop cannot open an SSH session with its current transport/setup |
| 500 | `ssh_session_error` | Failed to create the SSH session |

#### GET /api/loops/:id/port-forwards

| 500 | `port_forward_error` | Failed to delete the port forward |

#### POST /api/loops/:id/mark-merged

Mark a loop as externally merged and transition it to `deleted`.

This is useful when a loop branch was merged outside Ralpher (for example through a hosted pull-request flow) and you want to clean up the loop state without performing an in-app merge. In worktree-backed flows, branch/worktree cleanup remains part of the normal discard/purge lifecycle.

Only works for loops in final states (pushed, merged, completed, max_iterations, deleted).

**Response**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `not_found` | Loop not found |
| 400 | `mark_merged_failed` | Cannot mark as merged (e.g., loop is still running) |

---

### Pending Values

Set or clear pending message and/or model for the next iteration. This is the primary way to interact with running loops.

#### POST /api/loops/:id/pending

Set pending message and/or model for next iteration. By default (`immediate: true`), running ACP-backed loops prefer staying on the active session and applying the pending values on the very next iteration without interrupting the current turn. If the backend cannot support that flow, it falls back to interrupting the current iteration. Set `immediate: false` to wait for the current iteration to complete naturally.

Works for active loops (running, waiting, planning, starting) and can also jumpstart loops in supported stopped states (completed, stopped, failed, max_iterations).

**Request Body**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `message` | string | No | Message to queue for next iteration |
| `model` | object | No | Model change: `{ providerID, modelID }` |
| `immediate` | boolean | No | If true (default), prefer queueing on the active ACP session for running loops and fall back to interruption when unsupported. If false, wait for the current iteration to complete. |

At least one of `message` or `model` must be provided.

**Response**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 400 | `validation_error` | Neither message nor model provided, or message is empty |
| 400 | `model_not_enabled` | The selected model is not available |
| 404 | `not_found` | Loop not found |
| 409 | `not_running` | Loop is not in an active or jumpstart-eligible state |

#### DELETE /api/loops/:id/pending

Clear all pending values (message and model).

**Response**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Error | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 404 | `not_found` | Loop not found |
| 409 | `not_running` | Loop is not in an active state |

### Server Settings

Server settings are configured per-workspace. Each workspace can have different connection settings, allowing different providers/transports per project.
Settings use a single contract:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "provider": "opencode | copilot",
    "transport": "stdio | ssh",
    "hostname": "required for ssh",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "optional",
    "password": "optional",
    "identityFile": "optional"
  }
}
```

Execution behavior is derived automatically from `agent.transport`:
- `stdio` → local deterministic execution
- `ssh` → remote deterministic execution over SSH

Provider runtime command is derived from `agent.provider`:
- `opencode` → `opencode acp`
- `copilot` → `copilot --yolo --acp`

#### GET /api/workspaces/:id/server-settings

Get server settings for a specific workspace.

{"type":"loop.log","loopId":"abc-123","id":"log-1","level":"info","message":"Sending prompt to AI","timestamp":"2026-01-20T10:15:01.000Z"}

{"type":"loop.tool_call","loopId":"abc-123","iteration":3,"tool":{"id":"tc-1","name":"Write","input":{"path":"/src/foo.ts"},"status":"running"},"timestamp":"2026-01-20T10:15:05.000Z"}

{"type":"loop.plan.ready","loopId":"abc-123","planContent":"# Plan\n\n## Goals\n...","timestamp":"2026-01-20T10:16:00.000Z"}

{"type":"loop.todo.updated","loopId":"abc-123","todos":[{"id":"1","content":"Implement feature","status":"in_progress"}],"timestamp":"2026-01-20T10:17:00.000Z"}
```

**JavaScript Example**

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/api/ws');

ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected');
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (data.type === 'connected') {
    console.log('Connection confirmed');
    return;
  }
  console.log('Event:', data.type, data);
};

ws.onclose = () => {
  console.log('Disconnected');
  // Implement reconnection logic as needed
};
```

#### WS /api/ssh-terminal

Dedicated WebSocket endpoint for interactive SSH terminal sessions.

**Query Parameters**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `sshSessionId` | One of `sshSessionId` or `sshServerSessionId` is required | Connect to a workspace-backed SSH session |
| `sshServerSessionId` | One of `sshSessionId` or `sshServerSessionId` is required | Connect to a standalone SSH server session |

Standalone SSH server sessions require an initial auth message after the socket opens:

```json
{
  "type": "terminal.auth",
  "credentialToken": "token-uuid"
}
```

The terminal socket emits events such as `terminal.connected`, `terminal.output`, `terminal.clipboard`, `terminal.error`, and `terminal.closed`.

#### Forwarded Port Proxy Routes

Active loop port forwards are exposed through browser-facing proxy routes:

- `GET /loop/:loopId/port/:forwardId`
- `GET /loop/:loopId/port/:forwardId/*`
- WebSocket upgrades on the same paths

These routes proxy HTTP and WebSocket traffic to the loop's forwarded remote service and rewrite absolute paths/redirects so browser apps can run under the loop-scoped prefix.
